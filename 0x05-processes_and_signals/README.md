## Project Tasks
### 0. What is my PID
Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

### 1. List your processes
Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.
- Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
- Display in a user-oriented format
- Show process hierarchy
